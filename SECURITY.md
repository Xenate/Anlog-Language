## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

If you find a vulnerability in Anlog you can contact me at oobrad76@gmail.com. Reasonable vulnerabilities 
include bugs in the cryptography library in the standard libary, 
unespected behavior, among other things. If the vulnerability is accepted then we will plan to fix the vulnerability
as soon as possible preferably within two weeks. Once the vulnerability is resolved a notification will be posted at the top
of the readme alerting users to update the compiler.

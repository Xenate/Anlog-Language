# Anlog-Language

Anlog is the world's most beautiful programming language written and designed by the world's most humble person.

## Dependencies:
- SBT (scala build tool)

Anlog is going under major changes. The syntax has become extremely implicit and more concise and there have been major changes to the underlying logic as well. Currently I am building a parsing libary as all the existing libraries have poor design principles.
